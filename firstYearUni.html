<h2 id="how-to-learn-a-new-language">How to Learn a New Language</h2>
<p>This course was taught by Dr Matthew Barr and Dr Ali Gooya.</p>
<p>The course was split into 2 halves: “programming concepts” and “an introduction to OOP”.</p>
<p>The first half of the course was taught by Matt and covered a lot of things that I think most people had a good understanding of already, myself included, though I think it was a good opportunity to re-affirm what I knew about programming and I did learn new things in this part (static vs dynamic typing, overloading and casting, to name a few). I did enjoy this part of the course, Matt’s lectures were engaging and I enjoyed attending them.</p>
<p>We also had an assignment worth 10% of our grade which I enjoyed doing too. We were tasked with creating a guide for a programming language, covering all of the concepts we had covered in the first half of the course to show our understanding of the course content. I thought I’d try and be “different” and “cool” by writing a guide for LOLCODE, an esoteric language created as a joke. This proved to be impossible though as there were many lacking features of the language which prevented me from writing a “complete” guide. I ended up going with Ruby. I’d heard of Ruby and thought it’d be fun to learn a bit about it and make a guide on it. We were told that the assignment was open-ended to some extent and that we didn’t need to follow a certain format or writing style in order to get full marks, as long as it was clear we understood everything and presented it in an easy to understand manner.</p>
<p>The second half of the course was all about Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and was taught by Dr Ali Gooya. OOP is a concept which I had heard about before, but had never taken the time to try and understand. This was definitely a lot more difficult than the first half of the course due to my unfamiliarity with OOP concepts. This covered a lot of topics like classes, objects, encapsulation, abstraction, polymorphism and inheritance (+ much more). While I’m not going to try and explain any of those concepts in this review as I’m trying to keep it short and sweet, I’ll say how I found the way it was taught.</p>
<p>Ali’s lectures were definitely more challenging than Matt’s, though this isn’t down to Ali as a lecturer, but rather the course content. I found some concepts really difficult to understand at first, but I will say that a lot of the examples and analogies that were used throughout were really helpful. For example, there is a concept in OOP called an interface and Ali likened these to a legal contract in the sense that every class that uses it (or “signs” it in this analogy) must be able to do everything it says. Even after understanding “what” an interface is, it was difficult to understand “why” and “where” you would implement one. When we were in labs, it felt like I was writing a lot of boilerplate and thinking “I could’ve done the same thing in python in a few lines”. Though looking at it in my workplace, working on a fairly large Java Spring Boot app, those concepts start to make a lot more sense and I can see how these OOP concepts come into play. I will say that this part of the course is fairly condensed and fast paced which led me to spend a bit more time at home revising the notes and slides, as well as doing a bit of research to try and cement my understanding of some of the more difficult topics.</p>
<p>Ali as a lecturer was always helpful and would come over during live coding sessions to assist us if we struggled. He was patient and would take time during lectures to answer any questions that people had.</p>
<p>Overall, I enjoyed this course and I felt like it definitely prepared me for working on some Java code when I got back into the office.</p>
<h2 id="foundations-of-professional-software-engineering">Foundations of Professional Software Engineering</h2>
<p>This course was taught by Mr Derek Somerville</p>
<p>This course was definitely a bit different from How to Learn a New Language. It focused a lot more on the less “technical” part of programming and software development. This course covered subjects like: requirement gathering, development methodologies and software legal issues (e.g. copyright, GDPR, licences etc.). These topics were a bit dry and not exactly the most interesting things in the world, but Derek definitely tried to keep the lectures engaging, getting the class involved, telling us anecdotes about his experience in fintech and relating it back to the course content. He’s approachable and a good laugh.</p>
<h2 id="web-application-systems">Web Application Systems</h2>
<p>This course was taught by Dr Xianghua (Sharon) Ding.</p>
<p>This course covered a variety of “web” stuff which included front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript as well as giving us an introduction to the Python web framework, Django through the use of the textbook “Tango with Django”.</p>
<p>“Tango with Django” was created by a Glasgow University alumni and was the primary resource for us to learn about the various features of Django. For our coursework, we were tasked with completing the first 10 chapters, each of which had an exercise at the end. These had to be committed to a repository and would be auto-checked using a marking program. The book itself was well written and a good resource, but for me I felt that it was a bit of a copy-paste job for the most part and could’ve done with some more work which didn’t have as much hand-holding, maybe an open ended assignment to make a personal blog website? For one of the class tests we put our Django skills to the test by building a website for a school which would display a news feed based on a specification we were given. There were some requirements e.g. it must have an admin page to log into where the admin can add new articles, the articles must be stored in a database with certain fields, the articles should be shown on the homepage in date descending order etc. I found this fairly simple and will say that I have solid grasp on Django basics after doing this course.</p>
<p>There was also a group presentation where we had to come up with an idea for a website and how we’d go about designing it, such as what we’d use for the backend, frontend and database. We also had to create wireframes, showing how the website would look, describe our database schema and create user personas for the typical users that you might see on our site.</p>
<h2 id="computer-architecture-and-network-systems">Computer Architecture and Network Systems</h2>
<p>This course was taught by Dr S Waqar Nabi.</p>
<p>The course was split into 2 halves: “Computer Architecture” and “Network Systems”.</p>
<p>The first half of the course went over how computers actually work, going all the way down to AND, OR and NOT gates and working our way up to how Operating Systems work and how to write assembly code. This part of the course was amazing. The content was explained at a reasonable pace and was very interesting throughout. When we were learning about assembly, we wrote code for a hypothetical CPU called “Sigma16”. This was very different from any code I’d written in the past as you were writing at a very low level, addressing each register and space in memory. We had a piece of coursework where we had to perform operations on ordered lists like insertions, deletions and searching. Which seems easy at first glance, but it wasn’t hard to go wrong or get errors which could be difficult to debug at times. I still did enjoy doing this piece of coursework and I feel like I learned a lot from doing it. We also had a second piece of coursework which could be done in pairs. We were given partially completed code for a Sigma16 assembler and emulator. We found this fairly easy, so we spent a lot of time on the “extra credit” part where you could move up a grade band if you improved it in some way. We decided to use our experience from Web Application Systems to turn it into a web app that we hosted on PythonAnywhere and could be accessed by anyone. We had some fun doing this and ended up getting full marks on the coursework.</p>
<p>The second half of the course went over how networks and “the internet” works. I found this part of the course a bit more difficult as it felt a bit more theoretical than the first half. Things like the TCP/IP stack (set of protocols used by the internet) are hard to visualise and imagine how they work, whereas you can play around with logic gates in online editors and understand how they work. I didn’t find the second half of the course as interesting, but others did, so it’s just down to personal preference. We did learn how to use POSIX sockets which allowed us to write programs that could “connect” to another machine in order to send and recieve messages. Our coursework for this half was again in pairs, but was a bit more difficult as we were tasked with making a program which would allow you to send and recieve files up to 4GB between two machines, which took us a long time to debug certain issues and we ended up starting from scratch at one point.</p>
<p>Waqar is an amazing lecturer and an even nicer person. He would frequently stay after class to help anyone who needed help with understanding the lectures or the coursework. His lectures also had many jokes and were very engaging.</p>
<h2 id="testing-and-software-improvement">Testing and Software Improvement</h2>
<p>This course was taught by Mr Derek Somerville.</p>
<p>This course covered a lot of different tools to test code like using mocks, stubs and fakes. We did two pieces of coursework in order to get some practice in this. The first one was where we were tasked with creating a game of any kind, the functionality didn’t really matter. The important thing was that we used a design pattern talked about in the course and there was a comprehensive test suite. For this I created a game where you had to type words in morse code as fast as possible. I used the strategy design pattern to implement different ways to get a word - whether it be through a random word from a local text file, a random words API or a word that the user specifies. I also used mocks in the game in order to simulate the user typing in the morse code. I enjoyed making this game and think that open-ended assignments are a good way to go around teaching a concept as you can put your own spin on your submission. We also did a similar group assignment where we had to create an application for a shop. We decided to create a web interface for our shop using flask. We we did this in sprints and we were graded on things like how we worked together as an “agile” team, how we split up tasks into smaller sub-tasks and how we distributed the work. We were also graded on the quality of the tests for the shop’s backend. I found this fun as we were able to put our own spin on our shop site, we decided to make a t-shirt site and we had some fun coming up with some nonsensical mock t-shirts to be displayed in the catalogue and designing the look and feel of the site.</p>
<p>Overall this course was good, I think that there are still some concepts that aren’t 100% cemented in my head like mocks and fakes, but I believe that’ll come with putting these testing concepts into practice in the workplace.</p>
